#SHA-256 Password Generator

This simple Python 3 script allows you to generate secure pseudorandom passwords. The program will prompt you to enter a master password. Afterwords, you can enter the account website, username, and the desired password length. The password length can be up to 64 characters long. Afterwords, the program will generate a password made of hexadecimal digits. If you ever forget the password, you can generate it again by using the same master password, account website, username, and length. You can use the same master password to generate unique passwords for different sites by entering a different website name. Also, if your account gets hacked, you can change the length to get a completely new password.

*Be sure to use a secure master password to be protected from brute force and rainbow table attacks!!!!*
